# Call Classification Guide

Purpose: Provide clear, unambiguous rules for classifying calls in the plumbing/HVAC context. This guide is read by the AI on every classification.

## Booked Definition (TRUE only if ALL apply)
- Customer explicitly agrees to proceed with service.
- Clear scheduling intent: a request for technician arrival time or availability, or confirming a specific time window.
- Optional but supportive: price acceptance or acknowledgment that pricing is acceptable ("that works", "go ahead", "yes please").

Examples (Booked):
- "When can you come?"
- "Can you come out today at 3?"
- "That price is fine; go ahead."
- "Yes, book it for tomorrow morning."

## Not Booked (FALSE in these cases)
- Contractor-to-contractor status checks, coordination, or permit/inspection updates.
- Internal scheduling language without customer commitment (e.g., "we're getting our schedule", "making sure we're not over-scheduling").
- General inquiry, estimate requests without agreement to proceed.
- Follow-ups where no commitment is made ("keep me posted", "let me know").

Examples (Not Booked):
- "We're waiting on permits; I'll keep you updated."
- "We’re just trying to plan our schedule; let us know when you have an idea."
- "Can you send an estimate?" (no acceptance yet)
- "Just checking status on Mechanic Street."

## Pipeline Stage Guidance
- Booked: Only when the customer commits and scheduling is discussed/confirmed.
- Follow-Up: Caller asks to be updated or there's dependency (permits, parts) before scheduling.
- Inquiry: General questions or information gathering.
- Quote Needed: Explicit request for estimate prior to booking.
- Closed-Lost: Caller indicates not proceeding or going elsewhere.

## Special Handling: Contractor-to-Contractor Calls
- Treat as business coordination, typically "Follow-Up" or "Inquiry".
- Do NOT mark as booked unless there is explicit agreement to schedule a technician with time discussion.

## Language Patterns
Positive indicators for Booked:
- "send someone out", "what time can you be here?", "I’m available [time/day]", "that works for me", "go ahead", "yes please", "book it"

Negative indicators (Not Booked):
- "waiting on permits/inspection", "we’ll keep you updated", "let us know when you have an idea", "status check"

## Summary Rules
- When ambiguous, prefer NOT booked.
- Require explicit customer commitment + scheduling language for Booked.
