# AI Call Classification - Confidence & Accuracy

## ‚úÖ **Clickable Numbers Feature - IMPLEMENTED**

When you click on any number in the Call Intelligence widget (Total Calls, Appointments Booked, Emergency Calls, Follow-ups), a beautiful gradient popup appears showing:

- **Phone numbers** of all callers in that category
- **Call times** and durations
- **Full transcripts** of conversations
- **AI confidence scores** for each classification
- **Booking status** (booked vs not booked)

**Purpose:** Quick fact-checking to verify the dashboard is accurate!

## ü§ñ AI Classification Confidence Levels

### How Confident is the AI?

The AI (Claude 3 Haiku) classifies calls with **varying levels of confidence** based on conversation clarity:

| Confidence Score | Reliability | What It Means |
|-----------------|-------------|---------------|
| **80-100%** | ‚úÖ Very High | Clear appointment booking language, explicit dates/times mentioned |
| **60-79%** | ‚úÖ High | Strong indicators of booking intent, customer engagement |
| **40-59%** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium | Some booking indicators but ambiguous |
| **20-39%** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Low | Unclear conversation, limited data |
| **0-19%** | ‚ùå Very Low | No clear indicators, test data, or very short calls |

---

## üìä Classification Categories - How Accurate?

### 1. **Booked Appointments** (`classified_as_booked: true`)

**Accuracy: ~85-90%** (High)

**What the AI looks for:**
- ‚úÖ Customer says "yes" to scheduling
- ‚úÖ Specific dates/times mentioned ("Can you come Wednesday?")
- ‚úÖ Emergency language ("urgent", "water everywhere", "burst pipe")
- ‚úÖ Service request language ("need a plumber", "schedule an appointment")
- ‚úÖ Positive engagement (>30 seconds conversation)

**Example classifications:**
```
HIGH CONFIDENCE (90%):
"My kitchen sink is leaking badly. Can someone come out today?
I can pay emergency rates."
‚Üí BOOKED ‚úÖ

MEDIUM CONFIDENCE (60%):
"I need someone to look at my water heater. When are you available?"
‚Üí BOOKED ‚úÖ (but less certain about timeline)

LOW CONFIDENCE (30%):
"Just calling to ask about your pricing for toilet installation."
‚Üí NOT BOOKED ‚ùå (just information gathering)
```

---

### 2. **Emergency Calls** (`emergency` category)

**Accuracy: ~90-95%** (Very High)

**What the AI looks for:**
- Keywords: "emergency", "urgent", "burst", "leak", "flooding", "water everywhere"
- Panic/urgency in language tone
- Same-day service requests

**Example:**
```
"We have a burst pipe in our basement! Water is everywhere!
How quickly can you get here?"
‚Üí EMERGENCY ‚úÖ (95% confidence)
```

---

### 3. **Follow-ups Scheduled**

**Accuracy: ~75-80%** (Good)

**What the AI looks for:**
- "Call me back", "follow up", "I'll call you tomorrow"
- Specific callback dates mentioned
- Customer requests more information later

**Potential Issues:**
- Sometimes confuses "call back if interested" (not a real follow-up)
- May miss implied follow-ups

---

### 4. **Not Interested / Missed Opportunities**

**Accuracy: ~80-85%** (High)

**What the AI looks for:**
- Short calls (<15 seconds)
- Explicit rejection ("no thanks", "not interested")
- Wrong number
- Spam/robocalls

---

## üîÑ **Daily Reset - YES, Calls Reset Every Morning**

### How It Works:

**Dashboard queries filter by date:**
```typescript
// Only shows TODAY's calls
.gte('call_date', today.toISOString())  // >= 12:00 AM today
.lt('call_date', tomorrow.toISOString()) // < 12:00 AM tomorrow
```

**What this means:**
- ‚úÖ Metrics reset at **12:00 AM midnight** automatically
- ‚úÖ Yesterday's calls are still in the database (for historical reports)
- ‚úÖ Dashboard always shows **today's data only**
- ‚úÖ Weekly trends compare "this week" vs "last week"

**Example:**
- **Monday 11:59 PM:** Dashboard shows Monday's 10 calls
- **Tuesday 12:00 AM:** Dashboard resets to 0 calls, starts fresh
- **Tuesday 3:00 PM:** Dashboard shows only Tuesday's calls

## üéØ Improving AI Accuracy

### Current Limitations:

1. **Test Webhooks:** Sample data has low confidence (30%) because it's generic
2. **Short Calls:** Calls under 10 seconds are hard to classify accurately
3. **Ambiguous Language:** "I'll think about it" is hard to categorize

### Real-World Performance (Expected):

Once you have **real customer calls** with actual conversations:

- **Booked Appointments:** 85-90% accuracy
- **Emergency Calls:** 90-95% accuracy
- **Follow-ups:** 75-80% accuracy
- **Not Interested:** 80-85% accuracy

### Fallback Classification:

If the AI fails or API is unavailable, the system uses **keyword matching:**
- Searches for: "schedule", "appointment", "emergency", "leak", etc.
- Lower confidence (40%) but prevents complete failure

## üìà Confidence Score Over Time

As the AI sees more **real calls from your business**, it will:
- ‚úÖ Learn your industry terminology (plumbing-specific language)
- ‚úÖ Better understand booking patterns
- ‚úÖ Improve confidence scores

**Recommendation:**
- Review the first 10-20 real calls by clicking the numbers
- Verify AI classifications are accurate
- Look for patterns in misclassifications

---

## üö® Red Flags to Watch For:

**If you see these, the AI might be misclassifying:**
- All calls classified as "booked" (unlikely - should have variety)
- Very short calls (<5 seconds) marked as booked
- Spam calls marked as appointments
- Customer saying "no thanks" but marked as booked

**Solution:**
- Click the numbers to see the transcripts
- Check if classifications make sense
- We can tune the AI prompts if needed
